# Siamese Network for Image Pair Discrimination

## Project Overview
This project builds and trains a Siamese network to determine the similarity between two images. Using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries, it showcases how to handle image pairs, extract features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and classify these pairs based on their similarity, leveraging Euclidean distance.
